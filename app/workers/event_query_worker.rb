  # endpoint, it would be necessary to first search groups by location and then retrieve
  # events belonging to those groups. I didn't see any information about an
  # include directive being available to sideload events with groups.
  #
  # A known issue here is that the instructions for this challenge mention viewing past events.
  # The docs say it is possible to view both upcoming and past events with the
  # value 'status=past,upcoming', however, this is incorrect. The endpoint appears to
  # require only one value or the other, despite what the docs say.
  #
  # One simple improvement would be to use a fields directive to only load the
  # five fields we are using.
